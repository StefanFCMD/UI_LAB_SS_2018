## Prequesites

### Update to current NativeScript version

In order to work with the most current templates and tools, it is necessary to update the NativeScript cli tool before the creation of a new project:

	npm install -global nativescript

*If you want to know, how to install global npm packages on Linux or OSX without `sudo`, see [here](https://johnpapa.net/node-and-npm-without-sudo/).*


### Starting template

As a basic scaffold, we chose the NativeScript template **Tabs** with Angular/TypeScript. Other templates are available [here](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/app-templates). You don't have to execute the following command, because the template is already prepared in this repo. It's just here as a documentation:

	tns create uiLab --template tns-template-tab-navigation-ts


### Installation

After you checked out this repository, you only have to install the mising npm dependencies and you're ready to go:

	npm install
